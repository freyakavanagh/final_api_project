# Project Outline
This is a proof of concept project.

The product owner wants to explore the possibility of having a MongoDB and cloud-based solution for accessing information about movies, allowing users to post or read comments on movies and managing a film schedule for cinemas.

A sample database (sample_mflix) is provided which includes details of movies, comments, "theaters" and users.

Two products are required: - A RESTful API which allows full CRUD access to the existing data for these 4 collections

Required Technologies
- The persistence mechanism must be MongoDB
- The database must be hosted on MongoDB Atlas using the "Shared" (free) tier hosted on AWS
- The database must be based on the sample_mflix database, which is provided for use within MongoDB - this tutorial explains how to install the sample
- Spring Boot must be used for the API
- Spring Data MongoDB must be used for accessing the database from both the API and the Web application
- The code repository for the project must be hosted on GitHub

Testing
- The API itself should be internally tested using unit testing
- The API Testing framework should make use of good modeling (Connection, Injection and DTOs)
- The API Framework should also be internally tested
- Where possible, Code coverage should be reported on
- Consider using mocking when internally testing the RESTful API
